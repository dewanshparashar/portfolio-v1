- Developed (and designed) LogiNext LIVE; an interface for all logistics' real-time tracking and ad-hoc operations which proved to be a huge asset for the product reception and the business. Also, won the NASSCOM Design Award for presenting it.
- Developed a highly flexible and scalable map architecture atop LeafletJs, supporting use-cases involving various geometries: Polygons, Circles, Rectangles, Polylines (Routes), Heatmaps, Editing tools, Animations, various map providers like Google and OSM.
- Design Quality Automation: Initiated & delivered LogiNext Design Language aimed to document 100+ reusable components, standardizing our brand guidelines, drastically reducing the time to design new interfaces. I closely worked with managers to document and implement these atoms and molecules in StoryBook.
- Worked on the benchmarking, and optimizing rendering of the application at scale eg. bringing down the memory consumption of our dashboard by 60% with 10k moving markers.
- Team Building & Mentorship: Conducted 70+ interviews to date to hire Senior & Principal UI developers. 1 UI/UX Designer and 1 UI Developer reported to me.
