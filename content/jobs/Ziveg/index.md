- As the only tech person in the founding team of 4 people, I developed the E-commerce website Ziveg.com from scratch using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and backend using PHP and MySQL.
- Responsible for end-to-end ownership of requirement gathering, taking SKUs live on the website, and deploying the platform on AWS.
- I also helped the marketing lead to set up SEO, Analytics, Email integrations, coupon management etc, from the tech side.
- I also developed and shipped the admin panel from scratch for operations team. It featured SKU management and order and coupon tracking.
- I worked closely with the CEO on branding and design efforts. Since we were a small team running the business, I got exposure to things way outside my domain - like conducting photoshoots, product placements, setting up affiliate marketing channels, etc.
